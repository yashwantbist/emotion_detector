# AI-Based Emotion Detection Web Application 

This project is part of the final assignment for the "Working with AI Applications" course. It uses IBM Watson NLP to detect emotions in customer feedback and deploys the system as a Flask web application.

## Overview

The application takes customer feedback text as input and uses IBM Watson's `EmotionPredict` service to identify and return the levels of:
- Anger ðŸ˜ 
- Disgust ðŸ¤¢
- Fear ðŸ˜¨
- Joy ðŸ˜„
- Sadness ðŸ˜¢

The output also includes the **dominant emotion** based on the highest score.
